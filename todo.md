Probably good to have a "Start Here" button.
- Explains what a Maqam is 
- Shows color legend

Or have a landing page 100vh (but try not to make it too cheesy)


- Dark mode switch + implement dark mode decide on colors CSS

- Responsive typography?

- Differentiate in current RUN color (all notes) VS in current SCALE color (8 notes in scale)

- Descriptions - probably keep as static string and then just have the component manpipulate / split out any links on a | delimiter

- Implement Hijaz narrow interval

Nice to have:
- 3 way coupled Corresponding note highlighting on note pill, note, and piano key click

- Musical typing ?


- Video improvs of each maqam by me
