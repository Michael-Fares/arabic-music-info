Probably good to have a "Start Here" button.
- Explains what a Maqam is 
- Shows color legend


- Dark mode switch + implement dark mode decide on colors CSS

- Descriptions - probably keep as static string and then just have the component manpipulate / split out any links on a | delimiter

- Implement Hijaz narrow interval

Nice to have:
- 3 way coupled Corresponding note highlighting on note pill, note, and piano key click

- Musical typing ?


- Video improvs of each maqam by me
